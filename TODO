NodePackage
  Like ICs in R.O.; Simulator on the inside, Node on the outside. - IN PROGRESS

DelayLine
  Simulates N NOT gates stacked together, creating slice-wise delays.

Flip Flops / Registers
  Will implement 1 slice flipflops, and discrete flipflops using gates (depends on NodePackage).






LATER:

74 series chip alikes
GUI / Real Time simulator
