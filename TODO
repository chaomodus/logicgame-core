unit tests for objects:
   especially core behavior which is more complicated than is comfortable
   the interaction between various methods
   simulator

I have a vague concept for a command-line simulator that you can take a gate, and make a list
of frames you want to put he gate through, basically for testing - so on the command-line you'd
specify a gate init string, and then a series of pin states specified in terms of frames, and then
it'd print out the pin states over those frames.

simulator:
	finish generic container.
	finish simulator with state recording.


flip-flops (impelement as a monolithic instant gate and using discrete LUT-based gates)
delay lines
real time clocks (a clock component who's output is based on real time not on simulator time)
